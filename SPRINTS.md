Sprint 1: The "Hub" & Navigation Core
Objective: Transform architecture_of_ambition.html into the true "Lobby" (index.html) that can physically link to the "Files" (archetypes).

Task 1.1 (Rename): Rename architecture_of_ambition.html to index.html.

Task 1.2 (The "Casualties" Fix): Replace the "Coming Soon" placeholder in the Casualties section with the Archetype Grid Code (the code block I provided in the previous turn). This turns that section into a menu.

Task 1.3 (Hero Refinement): Update the main button text on the homepage from "Enter The Structure" to "Begin Analysis" or "Enter System" to better match the "file/surveillance" aesthetic.

Review Goal: You open index.html, click "The Casualties" in the nav, and see 5 clear cards. You click "The Watchman," and it successfully opens that file.

Sprint 2: The "Spokes" (Archetype Integration)
Objective: Ensure the standalone archetype pages don't feel like dead ends. They need a "Back Button."

Task 2.1 (The "Return" Link): In all 5 archetype files (watchman, visible, faithful, departed, architect), replace the top-left static text ("Architecture of Ambition") with a functional link: "← Return to System" (pointing back to index.html).

Task 2.2 (Cross-Linking): Update the Footer of each archetype page. Instead of just "Closing Provocation," add a small "Next File" link. (e.g., At the bottom of The Watchman, add a small link to The Visible).

Review Goal: You open The Watchman, read it, and can click "Return to System" to go back to the main dashboard without using the browser back button.

Sprint 3: Narrative & Data Polish
Objective: Smooth the "vibe" transition between the high-level city data and the personal psychological deep dives.

Task 3.1 (Context Blurb): Add a "Bridge Paragraph" to the top of the Casualties grid in index.html.

Draft Text: "The economic pressures of the City (Chapter 02) force the self into specific shapes for survival. These are not personality types; they are defense mechanisms."

Task 3.2 (The "Architect" Connection): Ensure the The Exits section on the homepage explicitly links to architect.html. The "Architect" is the practical application of the "Exits" theory, so they should be connected.

Review Goal: You read the flow from "The Cities" -> "The Casualties" -> "The Exits" and it feels like one cohesive argument, not three random pages.

Sprint 4: Final Polish & "The Exits"
Objective: Fill in the remaining "Under Construction" holes.

Task 4.1 (Resources Population): Populate the ResourcesView in index.html with the actual books/links mentioned in your README.md (e.g., Burnout Society, Tyranny of Merit) so the "Resources" tab isn't empty.

Task 4.2 (Visual Consistency Check): Ensure the font weights (Syne/Crimson Pro) on the Main Page match the specific "boldness" of the Archetype headers so the visual experience is seamless.

Review Goal: You click "Resources" and see a curated list of books. The entire site feels "finished" and ready to show a friend.
