## The Architecture of Ambition

A digital essay exploring how career became identity in modern cities, why extreme ambition is rational yet destructive, and what alternative frameworks offer. Research-driven analysis of workism, platform dynamics, and paths toward flourishing beyond performance.

## Project Overview

This website synthesizes extensive research into career-centric identity, housing precarity, and platform-amplified status anxiety among young professionals in global cities (Toronto, NYC, Vancouver, London). It offers both diagnostic analysis and alternative ethical frameworks (Christian vocation, Aristotelian virtue, humanistic psychology).

### Core Thesis
Extreme career ambition is a "rational maladaptation"—economically logical in cities with 10.4 price-to-income ratios, but psychologically destructive. Alternative architectures exist.

## Structure

- **The System**: Workism, tyranny of merit, status anxiety
- **The Cities**: Economic data from Toronto, Vancouver, NYC, London
- **The Machines**: LinkedIn and Instagram as engines of envy
- **The Casualties**: Millennial burnout, Gen Z algorithmic nihilism
- **The Exits**: Alternative frameworks (vocation, eudaimonia, self-transcendence)
- **The Practice**: Communication strategies for living differently

## Tech Stack

- React (scroll-based navigation, smooth transitions)
- CSS custom properties (design system)
- Recharts / D3 (data visualization)
- Framer Motion (animations)

## Design Direction

**Aesthetic**: "The Panopticon Revealed" - Editorial magazine meets data visualization meets architectural blueprint. Clean, intentional, generous spacing that respects reader attention.

## Development Phases

1. Foundation & core components
2. Homepage + Chapter 1 template
3. City comparisons + data visualizations
4. Platform analysis + interactivity
5. Alternative frameworks + resources
6. Polish + accessibility audit
