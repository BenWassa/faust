# Infographic Details
This document provides detailed descriptions and proposed filenames for the infographics used in the project. Each infographic is designed to visually represent key concepts and dynamics discussed in the text, enhancing understanding through graphical representation.

1. Digital surveillance and professional worth

**Original title**  
The Digital Panopticon: How Social Media Distorts Professional Worth

**Proposed filename**  
digital-panopticon-professional-worth.png

**Description**  
This diagram explains how LinkedIn and Instagram function as parallel surveillance systems that convert visibility into perceived value. By amplifying extreme success narratives and aestheticized lifestyles, these platforms generate continuous comparison, imposter syndrome, and identity fragility among young professionals.

**System role**  
Conceptual foundation. Introduces the panopticon logic that underlies later discussions of ambition, anxiety, and performative identity.

2. Career centrality versus identity resilience

**Original title**  
The Architecture of Ambition: Career Centrality vs. Identity Resilience

**Proposed filename**  
architecture-of-ambition-identity-fragility-vs-resilience.png

**Description**  
This visual contrasts a single-source, career-centric identity with a diversified identity structure distributed across family, community, and personal pursuits. It illustrates how high-status career focus produces psychological fragility, while identity complexity buffers against burnout, job loss, and existential collapse.

**System role**  
Structural thesis. Defines the core tradeoff of the project and provides the conceptual scaffolding for all subsequent analysis.

3. The Toronto economic-psychological trap

**Original title**  
The Toronto Trap: Why Young Professionals are Hustling toward Burnout

**Proposed filename**  
toronto-trap-defensive-ambition-burnout.png

**Description**  
This diagram frames extreme ambition among Toronto professionals as a rational response to housing unaffordability, wage compression, and global-city cost structures. It introduces the concept of "defensive ambition," where overwork is driven by fear of downward mobility rather than intrinsic aspiration, resulting in widespread burnout.

**System role**  
Material grounding. Anchors abstract psychological dynamics in concrete economic conditions and validates ambition as adaptive before showing its long-term costs.

4. Redefining success beyond workism

**Original title**  
The Architecture of Ambition: Redefining Success Beyond "Workism"

**Proposed filename**  
architecture-of-ambition-beyond-workism.png

**Description**  
This visual critiques modern careerism as a secular religion that equates worth with status and productivity. It introduces alternative frameworks for meaning and success drawn from Christian ethics, virtue ethics, and humanistic psychology, reframing failure as refinement rather than personal deficiency.

**System role**  
Normative reframing. Offers conceptual alternatives without prescribing lifestyle choices, preparing the reader for value diversification without moralizing.

5. Career anxiety problem-solution synthesis

**Original title**  
The Digital Panopticon: Navigating the Modern Career Anxiety Crisis

**Proposed filename**  
digital-panopticon-career-anxiety-problem-solution.png

**Description**  
This synthesis map integrates the dynamics of surveillance, defensive ambition, success theater, and identity foreclosure, then contrasts them with strategies for identity diversification, vocational reframing, and internal value orientation. It presents a navigational model rather than a checklist for escape.

**System role**  
Capstone and integration. Functions as a navigational overview that connects all prior visuals into a single explanatory system.
