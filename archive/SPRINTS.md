Sprint 1: The "Hub" & Navigation Core
Objective: Transform architecture_of_ambition.html into the true "Lobby" (index.html) that can physically link to the "Files" (archetypes).

Task 1.1 (Rename): Rename architecture_of_ambition.html to index.html.

Task 1.2 (The "Casualties" Fix): Replace the "Coming Soon" placeholder in the Casualties section with the Archetype Grid Code (the code block I provided in the previous turn). This turns that section into a menu.

Task 1.3 (Hero Refinement): Update the main button text on the homepage from "Enter The Structure" to "Begin Analysis" or "Enter System" to better match the "file/surveillance" aesthetic.

Review Goal: You open index.html, click "The Casualties" in the nav, and see 5 clear cards. You click "The Watchman," and it successfully opens that file.

Sprint 2: Archetype UI Upgrade — Template First
Objective: Upgrade archetype UI using the stylization of archive/archetype_pages/watchman.html, starting with the canonical template.

Task 2.1 (Reference Review): Audit archive/archetype_pages/watchman.html for layout, typography, spacing, and interaction patterns that should become the new standard.

Task 2.2 (Template Upgrade): Apply those stylizations to src/archetypes/archetype.html first (canonical template), without touching individual archetype pages yet.

Review Goal: The canonical template alone reflects the archive Watchman’s visual standard and can be used to drive updates across all archetypes.

Sprint 3: Archetype UI Upgrade — Per Page
Objective: Upgrade each archetype page individually using the refreshed template and specific needs per archetype.

Task 3.1 (Watchman Pass): Apply the updated template to watchman.html and verify parity with the archive stylization.

Task 3.2 (Remaining Pages): Apply the updated template to visible.html, faithful.html, departed.html, architect.html, resolving any layout/content edge cases.

Review Goal: All five archetype pages are visually consistent with the upgraded template and the archive Watchman reference.
